GameCube SP1 Port Breakout PCB

This is a set of PCB Gerbers I made for the Dol-001 Gamecube Serial Port 1 on the underside where the Broadband adapter plugs into 
to play around with the port and connect other devices too. When ordering the boards use 1.2mm pcb thickness, ENIG surface finish preferred but I used HASL
cause I'm cheap and its good enough for tests.

Connect EXTIN to Ground to enable the Port when in use to let the gamecube know a device is in.
